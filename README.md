# Car Agency System

## Description
The Car Agency System is an application that manages the inventory of a car agency. It includes various features such as reading and saving car data from a file, processing customer orders in a queue, storing sold cars in a stack, and providing options to add, delete, update, and search for car brands and cars within a brand. Customers can navigate through car brands, place orders, and use filters to limit search results. The admin can process orders, remove sold cars from the inventory, and generate a report of the last 10 sold cars. The system utilizes LinkedLists, Queues, and Stacks for data storage and requires the implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX.
